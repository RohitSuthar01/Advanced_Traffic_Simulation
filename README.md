🚦 Advanced Traffic Management System

The Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) is a web-based project designed to improve road traffic efficiency and safety using modern technologies. It provides a smart and interactive platform to monitor, analyze, and control traffic flow in real time.

This system helps reduce congestion, minimize waiting time at signals, and ensure smooth vehicle movement through intelligent traffic control logic. It can be integrated with sensors, cameras, and IoT devices to collect live traffic data and make automated decisions based on road conditions.

🔍 Features

Real-time traffic monitoring and control

Smart signal management based on traffic density

User-friendly dashboard for administrators

Data collection and analysis for traffic optimization

Scalable design for integration with IoT and AI modules

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for front-end interface

Node.js / Python (optional) – for backend (if applicable)

Sensors / IoT (optional) – for real-time data input

🚀 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to create an intelligent traffic control system that reduces jams, improves travel time, and enhances overall road safety using automation and data-driven decisions.
